Modern OpenGL with C++ for graphics rendering

This is a personal project to utilize modern OpenGL for graphics rendering.
Vertex shaders, Geometry shader, Fragment shaders were used for this work

## Dependencies ##

GLEW 2.2.0 (For OpenGL 3.3): https://glew.sourceforge.net/ <br />
GLFW 3.3.8 (For GUI windows handling): https://github.com/glfw/glfw <br />
FreeType (For texts on screen): https://freetype.org/download.html <br />
ASSIMP 3.3.1 (For mesh model imports): https://github.com/assimp/assimp



GLM 0.9.9.8 and stb_image.h: These lightweight open source libraries are included in the current project, so you don't need to download/link them separately.

## Implemented Functionalities ##

1. Custom mesh loading<br />
2. Directional lighting (based on Phong lighting - Ambient, Diffusional, Spectral)<br />
3. Point lighting<br />
4. Spot lighting + Flash light<br />
5. Directional shadow (shadowing cast by the directional lighting)<br />
6. Omnidirectional shadows (shadowing cast by point lights and spot lights)<br />
7. Skybox<br />

[TODO]<br />
1. Skeletal animation to improve realism in the scene<br />
2. Raytracing<br />
